# PowerBI Projects

Welcome to my personal Power BI portfolio repository! Here you will find a collection of Power BI projects and dashboards that demonstrate my skills and expertise in data visualization, business intelligence, and analytics using Power BI.

## [Project 1: Spotify Top Tracks Dashboard](Spotify%20Top%20Tracks)

This interactive Power BI dashboard analyzes the most streamed tracks on Spotify from 2018 to 2023, providing a detailed breakdown of streaming trends, artist performance, and song characteristics over time. The project leverages a dataset enriched with Spotify cover art images using the Spotify API and Python, integrating HTML visuals and DENEB-based custom visualizations to create a dynamic and insightful user experience. 

Highlights include:

 - **Track Insights:** Key metrics such as total streams, top tracks, and artist performance trends.
 - **Trend Analysis:** Yearly streaming averages and growth rates compared against historical data.
 - **Track Release Heatmap:** A custom DENEB visualization that shows how many tracks were released on specific days and months, offering insights into music release patterns over the years.
 - **Track Attributes:** Analysis of song characteristics like energy, danceability, and valence, presented through intuitive visuals, including a circular gauge for attribute percentages.
 - **User Engagement:** Interactivity features like filters for years, artists, and track selection to explore streaming patterns and insights dynamically.
